<h1>Developer's base</h1>
<p>
    You think it is time for some more advanced stuff? Then I have 2 tools for you: The Scripting-Language (MineCraft-Modder-Script = .mcms) or simple buttons. <br>
    There are of course advantages in my serverside scripting system in relation to speed, customization and shareability. My scripting-Stuff is saveable and you could publich this stuff easily over the interwebs!<br>

<h1>MCMS - Your Scripting, my server!</h1>
<p>
    MCMS (MC-Modder Script) is your choice (in fact; you don't have a real choice) to bring your ways of install on my server. It is primary developed by me and runs in PHP (Script in a Script - YAY!). <br>
