                            <h2>What's going on with my JAR?</h2>
                            <p>
                                Your jar file is uploaded to a htacces protected directory on my server, and will be modded with your choosen mods. The uploaded minecraft.jar will be extracted (the original jar will be deleted instantly) and saved to another directory. After your modding-process, the directories will be deleted (1min without download, 10min with download). I don't store any data from your PC, only a process-number is generated, and will be incremented with a new modding-process.  
                            </p>
