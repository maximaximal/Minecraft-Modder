        Risugamis ModLoader for MineCraft is required for nearly all mods. If I were you, I would install it ;)

<div id="info_MC-Forge">
    <p>
        MC-Forge is the Mod from Spacetoad and Eloraam. They had to make a Framework for modders which makes compatible modding easier (and even possible). This is needed for most of the "Techniqe-Mods" (RedPower, Industrial Craft, BuildCraft, ...) and many other mods.

<div id="info_TMI">
    <p>
        Too Many Items is the most famous Mod for ingame inventory editing. The Mod works well and it looks amazing, but it hasn't additional features (such as an item search as in NEI). TMI can save your inventory and you are allowed to restore it as you want.
